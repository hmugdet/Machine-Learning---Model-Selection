In this study, seven different models were evaluated by applying cross-validation and comparing their performance metrics including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R2). Among the evaluated models, 2 best perfoming models were selected and their parameters were optimized using GridSearchCV method. The parameters of the selected models were then optimized to maximize their predictive power. The optimized models were then applied to predict the holdout set. Lastly, performance of the models were compared.
